# NeuMorphic
```NeuMorphic is a cross-platform library for creating application components with neumorphic designs.```
```It's available on React Native, React and Vue. I also plan to release components for Flutter and Kotlin soon.```
## How To Use
``` Each platform (e.g React, React Native, CSS) has wrappers in separate branches. Simply select the branch for your project and clone or download.```
``` For React/React Native/Vue.js, copy/move the folder to your project directory.```
``` Import the wrapper as follows:```
``` import { Neumorphic } from <path/to/NeuMorphic>```
``` Wrap your components inside the Neumorphic wrapper:```
``` <Neumorphic> <IonIcons name='retweet' size={20) color='#777' /> </Neumorphic> ```
``` Neumorphic takes some props that can help you further customize the look for your components. Read the props section below.```
### Props
``` All values, except those marked with an *, are optional.```
``` size ---> Specify a value (pixels) for both the width and the height. Not to be used with the 'width' or 'height' props. Defaults to 40.```
``` width ---> Specify a value (pixels) for the width of the component.```
``` height ---> Specify a value (pixels) for the height of the component.```
``` background ---> Specify a background color (string, hex, hsl, or rgb) for the wrapper. Defaults to #F9FBFF.```
``` borderRadius ---> Specify a value (pixels) for the border radius of the wrapper. Defaults to 50% of the value of { size } (i.e makes the wrapper completely round if the width and height are equal.```
## Coming Soon...
``` Vue.js (JS and TS) support.```
``` Flutter support. ```
``` TS for React and React Native support.```
